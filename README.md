OpenStudio
==========

OpenStudio is a cross-platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux) collection of software tools to support whole building energy modeling using [EnergyPlus](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus) and advanced daylight analysis using [Radiance](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/Radiance).  OpenStudio is an open source project to facilitate community development, extension, and private sector adoption.

The OpenStudio SDK allows building researchers and software developers to quickly get started through its multiple entry levels, including access through C++, Ruby, Python, and C#.

Continuous Integration is facilitated through the use of the [decent_ci](https://github.com/lefticus/decent_ci) system.

The files `.decent_ci.yaml`, `.decent_ci-Linux.yaml`, `.decent_ci-Windows.yaml` and `.decent_ci-MacOS.yaml` in the root
folder configure the build system. 

For building OpenStudio, you need to set up the requirements for decent_ci, and follow its instructions here:

https://github.com/lefticus/decent_ci/blob/master/README.md

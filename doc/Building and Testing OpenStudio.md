Process of Building and Testing OpenStudio for Release
======================================================
Configured build environments: https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/Configuring-OpenStudio-Build-Environments

- 64-bit Windows environment
- 64-bit Ubuntu environment
- 64-bit OS X environment
- Git
- VMWare
- IncrediBuild
- S3
- SketchUp
- MarkdownPad 2


Release Notes
=============
If this is a major release, release notes must be written.

- Contact each OpenStudio developer and get from them a list of features and bug fixes which they feel should be highlighted.
- In the folder doc\ReleaseNotes copy the most recent release notes, and update the name to reflect the correct version, and date.
- Incorporate the developers notes previously obtained.
- Have the release notes reviewed for accuracy.
- Generate a PDF from the word doc.
- Update openstudiocore\cmakelists.txt to package the latest release notes pdf.
- With Git, commit above files (Commit Message = `Updating release notes X.Y.Z`) to the develop branch
- Generate a markdown document from the word doc.


Updating HVAC lib
=================
If this is a major release, the HVAC library must be updated.

Run `developer/ruby/UpdateHVACLibrary.rb` (ruby -I E:\Git\OS1\build\Products\ruby\Release UpdateHVACLibrary.rb)

Commit the updated files to develop.


Updating EnergyPlus
===================

If a new version of EnergyPlus is to be incorporated into OpenStudio
- Upload the 3 versions (Windows 64, Ubuntu, and Linux) to S3's folder `openstudio-resources/dependencies`
- In the ./openstudiocore folder, update `CMakeLists.txt` following
	- ENERGYPLUS_VERSION_MAJOR
	- ENERGYPLUS_VERSION_MINOR
	- ENERGYPLUS_VERSION_PATCH
	- ENERGYPLUS_BUILD_SHA
	- ENERGYPLUS_EXPECTED_HASH (In 3 places: Win 32, Win 64, Darwin, and Linux)

Note: use HashTab, or similar, to determine the MD5 hash value for each file referenced above.


Updating OpenStudio Server used by PAT
======================================

If there is a new server build, bump the server SHA (both for Mac and Windows) in manifest.json in the root folder of PAT.


Updating PAT
==========================

Bump the PAT SHA in OpenStudio's openstudiocore/pat/CMakeLists.txt.


Initial Steps
=============
If internal to NREL, connect to developer VPN (avoids certificate warnings, increases speed of uploads).

- With Git, merge `develop` into `iteration`.

If this is a major release

- With Git, merge `develop` into `master`.


DView Builds
======

Ubuntu
------
With Git, pull `iteration` branch.

Ensure the correct version of wxWidgets is installed (currently 3.1.0, us "apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-dev")

In a command window:

    cd openstudio/buildMeta
	ccmake ../

In CMake check the following:

- BUILD\_DVIEW
- CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE = Release

In CMake type the following:

	c
	g

In a command window:

	make DView

Compress folder DView-install with DView, and upload to S3.

Windows 64-bit
--------------
With Git, pull `iteration` branch.

Ensure the correct version of wxWidgets is installed (currently 3.1.0)

In CMake, select current 64-bit compiler

Point CMake to the top folder for source, and buildMeta folder for binaries

Ensure the correct version of wxWidgets is installed (currently 3.1.0)

In a command window:

	cd openstudio/buildMeta
	ccmake ../

In CMake check the following:

- BUILD\_DVIEW
- CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE = Release

In CMake type the following:

	c
	g

In a command window:
```bash
make DView –j16
# When done:
⌘ + q (to quit a Mac app)
```

Locate the folder DView-install, right click and use Mac's compression algorithm. Upload to S3.

Update all DView MD5 values in openstudiocore/cmakelists.txt and upload to OpenStusio's GitHub repository.

OpenStudio 2 Builds
======

Note: If the desire is to build OpenStudio 1.x, refer to the earlier version of this document dated 12/9/2016.

Ubuntu
------
With Git, pull `iteration` branch.

In a command window:

    cd openstudio/build
	ccmake ../openstudiocore

In CMake check the following:

- BUILD\_DVIEW
- BUILD\_OS\_APP
- BUILD\_PACKAGE
- CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE = Release

In CMake **uncheck** the following:

- CPACK_BINARY_FOO (uncheck all)
- CPACK_SOURCE_FOO (uncheck all)

In CMake **check** the following:

- CPACK\_BINARY\_DEB

In CMake type the following:

	c
	g

In a command window:

	make –j16 (16 indicates the number of cores used, the max number allowed by VMware 12)
	make package

Copy .deb package from VM to Windows

Windows 64-bit
--------------
With Git, pull `iteration` branch.

In CMake, select current 64-bit compiler

Point CMake to the openstudiocore folder for source, and build folder for binaries

In CMake check the following:

- BUILD\_CSHARP\_BINDINGS
- BUILD\_DOCUMENTATION
- BUILD\_DVIEW
- BUILD\_OS\_APP
- BUILD\_PACKAGE
- BUILD\_PAT
- BUILD\_TESTING

In CMake **uncheck** the following:

- CPACK_BINARY_FOO (uncheck all)
- CPACK_SOURCE_FOO (uncheck all)


Press `Configure` and `Generate` in CMake

In Visual Studio:

- Open OpenStudio.sln
- Select **Release** Solution Configuration
- Build ALL_BUILD with IncrediBuild
- Build PACKAGE

Mac
---
With Git, pull `iteration` branch.

In a command window:

	cd openstudio/build
	ccmake ../openstudiocore

In CMake check the following:

- BUILD\_DVIEW
- BUILD\_OS\_APP
- BUILD\_PACKAGE
- BUILD\_PAT
- CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE = Release

In CMake **uncheck** the following:

- CPACK_BINARY_FOO (uncheck all)
- CPACK_SOURCE_FOO (uncheck all)

In CMake **check** the following:

- CPACK\_BINARY\_IFW


In CMake type the following:

	c
	g

In a command window:

```bash
make package –j16
# When done:
⌘ + q (to quit a Mac app)
```

Locate the package, right click and use Mac's compression algorithm.

Copy build to VM's share folder

**Note:** The package will appear to be an empty folder in the build directory, when in fact the package is in OpenStudio/build/_CPack_Packages/Darwin/IFW and it's file name will have no file type extension.

**Note:** Making a build while on NREL's network (even the Dev VPN) and using a VMWare Mac VM will often fail when cmake attempts to download from GitHub the PAT SHA-specific zip file, meaning the developer will need to do this step manually. Example: https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT/archive/f942affb1897678c4dc17a137fcf338e00da2cfb.zip. The contents off the above zip file's parent directory will need to be deleted prior to attempting again to build the package.

OSVersion Testing
=================

In folder `build\Products\Release`

- Open cmd prompt
- Drag and drop `openstudio_osversion_tests.exe` onto the prompt, then run
- Make sure everything passes

Commit GitHubIssueStats.rb and CHANGELOG.md to the develop branch


Version Update
==============

The current version (X.Y.Z) being built, and the updated version (X.Y.Z+1) for the upcoming iteration need to be correctly incorporated into their respective documents.

- In the top level of your OpenStudio folder, update `CMakeLists.txt` version to X.Y.Z+1 (3 lines), e.g. `set(CMAKE_VERSION_MAJOR 2)`, `set(CMAKE_VERSION_MINOR 0)`, `set(CMAKE_VERSION_PATCH 1)`
- In the openstudiocore level of your OpenStudio folder, update `CMakeLists.txt` version to X.Y.Z+1 (1 line), e.g. `project(OpenStudio VERSION 2.0.1)`
- Copy file `openstudiocore\resources\model\OpenStudio.idd` to `openstudiocore\src\utilities\idd\versions\x_Y_Z` (new folder)
- In `openstudiocore\resources\model` update `OpenStudio.idd` version to X.Y.Z+1 (1 line)
- In `openstudiocore\src\osversion` update `VersionTranslator.cpp` version to X.Y.Z+1 in first location, and X.Y.Z in second location

At https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/blob/develop/openstudiocore/src/osversion/VersionTranslator.cpp

- Select "History", see edits if needed (usually use `defaultUpdate` in first location, 1 line for each of 2 locations)

With Git, commit above files (Commit Message = `Update version to X.Y.Z+1`) to the develop branch

SketchUp Extension Signature
=========
Check if either file below has been updated:
- `openstudiocore/ruby/openstudio/sketchup_plugin/OpenStudio.rb` (Note: not valid in OS2.x)
- `openstudiocore/sketchup_plugin/plugin/OpenStudio/Startup.rb`

If either file was updated, the SketchUp Extension Signature must be updated in
- `openstudiocore/sketchup_plugin/plugin/OpenStudio/OpenStudio.hash`

To do this: (Note: not valid in OS2.x)
- Build an OpenStudio package
- Zip the contents (OpenStudio.rb and OpenStudio folder) in `build\_CPack_Packages\win64\NSIS\OpenStudio-x.y.z.sha-Win64\Ruby\Plugins`
- Change the extension of the zip file from .zip to .rbz
- Login to https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/developer_center/extension_signature as openstudio@nrel.gov
- Drag the .rbz file into the upload box, upload the file, click 'Sign The Extension' (do not select any options to encrypt the ruby files)
- Download the signed .rbz file, and extract the files over the originals in `build\_CPack_Packages\win64\NSIS\OpenStudio-x.y.z.sha-Win64\Ruby\Plugins`
- Copy the new OpenStudio.hash file over the existing one in `openstudiocore/ruby/openstudio/sketchup_plugin`, and commit the new OpenStudio.hash file
- Rebuild the OpenStudio package

AMI BUILD
=========
On first use, install the required gems using a command prompt, with Ruby in the PATH.

- In the top level of your OpenStudio-server folder, run

```ruby
gem install bundler
bundler install
```

With Git, make feature branch of OpenStudio-server develop, and name it "OS.x.y.z.sha"

- In `server\lib\openstudio_server\version.rb`, update VERSION_EXT to `-OS.x.y.z.sha` (ex: `-OS.1.12.2.462ae9e746`).
- In `CHANGELOG.md`, add new server and openstudio versions (ex: `Version 1.19.1-OS.1.12.2.462ae9e746`, `OpenStudio 1.12.2.462ae9e746`).
- In `vagrant\chef\roles\openstudio.rb`, update version and version_revision (ex: `1.12.2`, `462ae9e746`)

With Git, commit above files to new branch (Commit Message = `Bump OpenStudio version to OS.x.y.z.sha`)
With Git, submit pull request

In a command window:

- In the top level of your OpenStudio-server folder, run `rake release`

Compatibility Matrix
====================

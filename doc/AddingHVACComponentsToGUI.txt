Process for adding HVAC components to gui.
This assumes that the model object(s) already exist.

Add icon:

  You probably need two icons, a full size icon that is 100 x 100, and
  a mini icon that is 24 x 24.  Marjory is really excellent at making these.

  Copy the full size icon to openstudiocore/src/openstudio_lib/images/, and
  the mini icon to openstudiocore/src/openstudio_lib/images/mini_icons/.

  Add two entries to the file openstudiocore/src/openstudio_lib/openstudio.qrc.
  This file registers the image files so that they become resources in the exectuable.
  Add one entry for the full size icon and one for the mini icon.

  Add two entries to the file openstudio/src/openstudio_lib/IconLibrary.cpp.
  This file contains a big map of the new OS type to the proper icon.

Make the library aware of the new type:

  Tell the library UI to look for the new type in the library and
  display any instances of the type when the HVAC tab is active.

  Do this by editing openstudiocore/src/openstudio_lib/MainRightColumnController.cpp.
  In the function MainRightColumnController::configureForHVACSystemsSubTab(int subTabID),
  add an entry to libraryWidget->addModelObjectType(...

  This will make a new category in the library chooser on the right so that you
  can drag and drop instances of the new type into the HVAC scene.

Add one or more instances of the new model object to the HVAC library:

  Edit openstudiocore/src/openstudio_app/Resources/hvaclibrary/hvac_library.osm.
  Add new osm text for the model object.  The trick is creating this text.  Perhaps
  the easiest way is to use the ruby bindings for the new model object.

  Assuming you have built ruby bindings for the new type fire up irb and point it to the
  ruby bindings in your build directory.  Somethin similar to this...
  irb -I path/to/openstucio/build/ruby

  require 'openstudio'

  m = OpenStudio::Model::Model.new
  c = OpenStudio::Model::NewComponentFoo.new(m)

  puts m <---- or just m and irb will print the osm text to the screen.
  You can copy part of this text into the hvac_library.osm

Thats all I can think of.  Let's refine as we try this out.  -Kyle

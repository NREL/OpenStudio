# Overview

As of April 2020, development and distribution of the OpenStudioApplication and the SketchUp plugin have transitioned to the OpenStudio Coalition, who is independently managing and distributing the software through its own [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) repository. The OpenStudio SDK is continuing to be actively developed and distributed by NREL and is released two times per year, through a spring and a fall release.

Below is the list of components that is included in this SDK installer:

__**OpenStudio SDK 3.7.0**__
- EnergyPlus
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Radiance
- Ruby API
- C++ SDK

**Note** that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) is not included in either the SDK or the OpenStudio Coalition's Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) GitHub page.

OpenStudio SDK 3.7.0 supports Radiance 5.0.a.12, which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer; users no longer must install Radiance separately, and OpenStudio will use the included Radiance version regardless of any other versions that may be installed on the system.

As usual, you can refer to the **[OpenStudio SDK Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/OpenStudio-SDK-Version-Compatibility-Matrix)** for more information.


## Installation Steps

- Download and install [OpenStudio SDK](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio) and/or [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) depending on your needs. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.
- Setup a Building Component Library (BCL) account to access online building components and measures. View instructions on how to setup your account and configure the key in OpenStudio.
- The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in requires SketchUp 2021-2022 (not available for Linux). The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in does not support older versions of SketchUp. SketchUp must be installed before OpenStudio Application to automatically activate the plugin. If you install SketchUp after OpenStudio Application, simply re-run the OpenStudio Application installer.

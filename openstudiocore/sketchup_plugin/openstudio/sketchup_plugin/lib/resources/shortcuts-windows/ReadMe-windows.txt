You can install the keyboard shortcuts for the Windows version of SketchUp from within
SketchUp's preferences by choosing "Import", and selecting
"...Google SketchUp 7\Plugins\OpenStudio\lib\resources\shortcuts-windows".
If you have customized SketchUp's default shortcuts and you want to save them, you should
first choose "export" to save your settings prior to importing the OpenStudio shortcuts.
Then when you want to go back to your original set you can re-import it. If you ever want
to get back to SketchUp's default shortcuts you can do that from within SketchUp's preferences.

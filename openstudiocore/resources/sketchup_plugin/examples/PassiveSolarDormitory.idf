! R-19 Wall Insulation, 6" blown rigid cellulose
! Based on spec for ApplegateInsulation:  R-3.8/inch and 1.6 lb/ft3
! Specific heat from "IN14", Cellulose Fill 3.5 in R-20 in DOE-2Materials.idf
! NOTE:  This results in a wall of > R-19, more like R-22.8
!        This value has been derated to account for framing, etc. according to the ORNL Whole Wall R-Value Calculator.
!        Since "rigid cellulose" was not in the library, similar values for 2x6, 16 o.c. framing with loose cellulose and polyurathane
!        were used to estimate.  Loose cellulose had a clear wall R-value of 18.12 with 23% reduction for the whole wall.
!        Polyurathane has a clear wall R-value of 25.34 with 32% reduction for the whole wall.
!        The assumption here is that rigid cellulose is better than loose cellulose, but not as good as polyurathane.
!        Interpolating between the two, the best estimate is to derate the rigid cellulose by 28%.
!        Putting in more data about the house suggests this value could be derated even more!

!      (Assume door is often open.)
!   2. Bedrooms and sunspace have maximum mixing in winter months when sunspace is hotter.
!      (Sunspace gathers heat during the day and heats the bedrooms through open doors.)
!   3. Bedrooms and sunspace have minimum mixing in winter months when bedrooms are hotter.
!      (Doors are kept closed to retain heat, generally at night.)

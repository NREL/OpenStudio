   A6,  \field Remaining Into Variable
        \note If the blocks do not use all of the energy or demand from the source some energy and demand remains
        \note then the remaining amount should be assigned to a variable. If no variable is assigned and some amount
        \note of energy or demand is not used in the block structure a warning will be issued.
   A7,  \field Block Size Multiplier Value or Variable Name
        \note The sizes of the blocks are usually used directly but if a value or a variable is entered here the block
        \note sizes entered in the rest of the charge are first multiplied by the entered value prior to being used.
        \note This is common for rates that are kWh/kW rates and in that case the variable that holds the monthly
        \note total electric demand would be entered.  If no value is entered a default value of one is assumed so
        \note that the block sizes remain exactly as entered.  This field is unusual for the EnergyPlus syntax because
        \note it can be either a number or a name of a variable.
   A8,  \field Block Size 1 Value or Variable Name
        \begin-extensible
        \note The size of the block of the charges is entered here. For most rates that use multiple blocks this will
        \note be the value for the block size. Using remaining may be used when the remaining amount should be included
        \note in that block.  This field is unusual because it can be either a number or a name of a variable.
   A9;  \field Block 1 Cost per Unit Value or Variable Name

        \note This is the name associated with the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple object and will appear in the report.
        \note In addition the results of the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple calculation are stored in a variable with the
        \note same name.  That way the results may be used for further calculation.  Spaces are not significant in

   A2,  \field Tariff Name
   A3,  \field Source Variable
        \note The name of the source used by the UtilityCost:Charge:Simple.  This is usually the name of the variable

   A6;  \field Cost per Unit Value or Variable Name
        \note This field contains either a single number or the name of a variable.  The number is multiplied with
        \note all of the energy or demand or other source that is specified in the source field.  If a variable is
        \note used then the monthly values of the variable are multiplied against the variable specified in the
        \note source field.  This field makes it easy to include a simple charge without specifying block sizes.
        \note This is a good way to include a tax or cost adjustment.

   A7,  \field Threshold Test
        \type choice
        \key Count
        \key Consecutive
        \note Uses the number in Number of Months in one of two different ways depending on the Threshold  Test. If
        \note the Threshold Test is set to Count then the qualification is based on the count of the total number
        \note of months per year.  If the Threshold Test is set to consecutive then the qualification is based on
        \note a consecutive number of months.
   N1;  \field Number of Months
        \minimum 1
        \maximum 12
        \note A number from 1 to 12.  If no value entered 12 is assumed when the qualify type is minimum and 1 when
        \note the qualify type is maximum.  This is the number of months that the threshold test applies to determine
        \note if the rate qualifies or not.  If the season is less than 12 months (if it is not annual) then the
        \note value is automatically reduced to the number of months of the seaon.
        
OS:UtilityCost:Ratchet,

        \note The name of the ratchet and the name of the result of this single ratchet.
   A2,  \field Tariff Name
   A3,  \field Baseline Source Variable
        \note When the ratcheted value exceeds the baseline value for a month the ratcheted value is used but when the
        \note baseline value is greater then the ratcheted value the baseline value is used. Usually the electric
        \note demand charge is used.  The baseline source variable can be the results of another ratchet object. This
        \note allows utility tariffs that have multiple ratchets to be modeled.
   A4,  \field Adjustment Source Variable
        \note The variable that the ratchet is calculated from. It is often but not always the same as the baseline
        \note source variable.  The ratcheting calculations using offset and multiplier are using the values from the
        \note adjustment source variable. If left blank the adjustment source variable is the same as the baseline
        \note source variable.
   A5,  \field Season From

        \note The name of the season that is being examined.  The maximum value for all of the months in the named
        \note season is what is used with the multiplier and offset.  This is most commonly Summer or Annual.  When
        \note Monthly is used the adjustment source variable is used directly for all months.

        \note The name of the season when the ratchet would be calculated.  This is most commonly Winter.  The ratchet
        \note only is applied to the months in the named season. The resulting variable for months not in the Season To
        \note selection will contain the values as appear in the baseline source variable.
   A7,  \field Multiplier Value or Variable Name
        \note Often the ratchet has a clause such as "the current month demand or 90% of the summer month demand".  For
        \note this case a value of 0.9 would be entered here as the multiplier.  This value may be left blank if no
        \note multiplier is needed and a value of one will be used as a default.
   A8;  \field Offset Value or Variable Name
        \note A less common strategy is to say that the ratchet must be all demand greater than a value in this case
        \note an offset that is added to the demand may be entered here. If entered it is common for the offset value
        \note to be negative representing that the demand be reduced.   If no value is entered it is assumed to be
        \note zero and not affect the ratchet.

        \note Is a multiplier used to convert energy into the units specified by the utility in their tariff. If
        \note left blank it defaults to 1 (no conversion). This field should will be used only if Conversion Factor
        \note Choice is set to UserDefined.  Within EnergyPlus energy always has units of J (joules).  For
        \note conversion from J to kWh use the value of 0.0000002778. This is also used for all objects that
        \note reference the UtilityCost:Tariff.
   N2,  \field Demand Conversion Factor
        \type real
        \note Is a multiplier used to convert demand into the units specified by the utility in their tariff. If
        \note left blank it defaults to 1 (no conversion).  This field should will be used only if Conversion
        \note Factor Choice is set to UserDefined.  Within EnergyPlus demand always has units of J/s (joules/sec)
        \note which equivalent to W (watts).  For conversion from W to kW use the value of 0.001. This is also used

        \note at the same time as the breaks between months i.e. at midnight prior to the first day of the month.
        \note If other billing periods are used such as two month cycles or a single bill for an entire season such
        \note as some natural gas companies do in the summer then the month schedule may be used to redefine it.
        \note Make sure that the month schedule and season schedule are consistent otherwise an error will be issued.

        \key Week
        \note The determination of demand can vary by utility. Some utilities use the peak instantaneous demand
        \note measured but most use a fifteen minute average demand or a one hour average demand. Some gas utilities
        \note measure demand as the use during the peak day or peak week.
   A8,  \field Monthly Charge or Variable Name
        \note The fixed monthly service charge that many utilities have.  The entry may be numeric and gets added to
        \note the ServiceCharges variable or if a variable name is entered here its values for each month are used.
   A9,  \field Minimum Monthly Charge or Variable Name
        \note The minimum total charge for the tariff or if a variable name is entered here its
        \note values for each month are used.

        \note schedule with the actual real time prices entered in the schedule.
   A11, \field Customer Baseline Load Schedule Name
        \note Used with real time pricing rates. The name of a schedule that contains the baseline

        \note difference between the baseline use and the actual use.
   A12, \field Group Name
        \note The group name of the tariff such as distribution transmission supplier etc. If more than one tariff
        \note with the same group name is present and qualifies only the lowest cost tariff is used. Usually the group

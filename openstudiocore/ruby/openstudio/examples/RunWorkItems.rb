# == Synopsis 
#
#   Runs an OpenStudio Model through a workflow defined by an
#   OpenStudio::Runmanager::WorkItemVector that has been serialized to 
#   the model's companion folder as a json file. 
#
#   This script assumes an extended OpenStudio Application file 
#   structure, that is:
#
#     myModel.osm
#     myModel/
#       files/
#       run/
#       scripts/
#       run.db
#       work_items.json
#
#   This script re-uses run.db and the myModel/run/ directory, so make 
#   a copy of your model first if you want to preserve that data. In 
#   addition, this script collects log messages in a file 
#   myModel/RunWorkItems.log.
#
# == Usage
#
#   ruby RunWorkItems.rb ARGV[0] 
#     
#     ARGV[0] - Path to .osm file. 
#
# == Examples
#
#   The contents of the following test show how to set up an OpenStudio 
#   Model for use with this script.
#
#   ruby test/RunWorkItems_Test.rb

/** \mainpage OpenStudio %Measure
 *
 *  The OpenStudio %Measure sub-project provides classes for building model parameterization,
 *  manipulation, and queries. \link UserScript UserScripts\endlink are typically instantiated
 *  in Ruby scripts packaged as BCLMeasures (see openstudio::BCLMeasure in the utilities
 *  sub-project).
 *
 *  \section user_scripts_sec UserScripts
 *
 *  Every OpenStudio UserScript/BCLMeasure is a class, typically written in Ruby, that derives from
 *  one of the classes listed below (\link ModelUserScript ModelUserScripts\endlink are the most
 *  common).
 *
 *  \li UserScript
 *  \li ModelUserScript - Base class for scripts that operate on OpenStudio Models
 *  \li WorkspaceUserScript - Base class for scripts that operate on EnergyPlus IDF
 *  \li ReportingUserScript - Base class for scripts that operate on EnergyPlus results
 *
 *  \link UserScript UserScripts\endlink are folded into OpenStudio workflows using the classes:
 *
 *  \li OSArgument - Class for specifying and setting values for script arguments.
 *  \li OSResult - Class for capturing an overall result flag; error, warning, and info messages; and
 *                 the initial and final conditions that occur during a single instance of running
 *                 a user script (typically on an energy model).
 *  \li OSRunner - Class for running scripts. All of the UserScript classes expect a class derived
 *                 from OSRunner to be passed in to the run method. The base class provies helper
 *                 methods for checking arguments and aggregating results. There is typically one
 *                 derived class per application, which can be used to customize application
 *                 behaviors (finding available measures/scripts, alerting the user when there is
 *                 an error, etc.)
 *  \li RubyUserScriptArgumentGetter - Standard methods for retrieving UserScript \link OSArgument
 *                 arguments\endlink using embedded or native Ruby.
 *
 *  For more information, see BCLMeasure (in utilities/bcl/), runmanager::RubyJobBuilder,
 *  analysis::RubyPerturbation, analysis::RubyContinuousVariable, the SketchUp Plug-in (user script
 *  menu), the OpenStudio Application (scripts tab), analysisdriver::SimpleProject, and the
 *  Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT).

/***
* MeasureManager provides a single interface for finding measures on the user's computer in a variety of places.
*
* It also manages checking if a newer version of a given measure is available on the user's computer and updating
* the current project to use the updated measure.  Measures directories are searched in the following order
* 1) my measures, 3) bcl measures.  This supports the following use cases:
*
* A user has started a measure in their my measures directory, then uploaded to BCL, then downloaded that measure. In this case
* a measure with the same uid will exist in both my measures and the bcl measures.  The my measures version is preferred.
*
* A user has downloaded a measure from the bcl to their local bcl and manually copied the directory to my measures.
* This use case is not supported but in this case the my measures version is preferred.
*
* A user has manually downloaded a measure from the bcl to their my measures directory as well as downloaded it to their local bcl.
* In this case the my measures version is preferred.
*
* A user has manually copied a measure in their my measures directory to their my measures directory.
* In this case only one of the measures is displayed.

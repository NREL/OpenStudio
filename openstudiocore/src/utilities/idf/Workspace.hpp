/** Workspace holds a collection of interconnected \link WorkspaceObject WorkspaceObjects\endlink.
 *  Similar to IdfFile, Workspace represents data (typically a whole or partial building energy
 *  model) in EnergyPlus Input Data File (IDF) format, and each instance of Workspace is
 *  constructed from a specific IddFile (either explicitly or using the IddFactory plus an
 *  IddFileType.) Workspace is shared so that changes to a copy of a Workspace changes the
 *  original as well.
 *
 *  Workspace contains the following types of \link WorkspaceObject WorkspaceObjects\endlink:
 *    - unique objects, indexed by type, should be present 0-1 times
 *    - objects with no associated reference lists, indexed by type and first field value, present
 *      0-inf times
 *    - objects with one or more associated reference lists, indexed by type, name, and
 *      reference list name, present 0-inf times
 *  Workspaces based on EnergyPlus IDDs are stuck with the above ways of identifying referenced
 *  objects in serialized form. As of Version 0.7.4, OpenStudio IDD serializes a Universal Unique
 *  Identifier (UUID) for each object, and uses this identifier to make inter-object connections.
 *  With this change, it is possible for an IdfObject field to use the OpenStudio-specific
 *  \\object-list AllObjects (see OS:ComponentData for an example).
 *
 *  Although Workspace and IdfFile share many important characteristics, there is no direct
 *  inheritance relationship between the two since their implementations are fundamentally
 *  different. */

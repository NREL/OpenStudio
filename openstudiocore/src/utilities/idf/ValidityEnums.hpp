 *
 *  Strictness::None
 *
 *  \li NoIdd (field-level, collection-level) - The input data definition is missing or empty.
 *  \li NotInitialized - Data is not ready for use or has been removed from the collection.
 *
 *  Strictness::Draft
 *
 *  \li NoIdd (object-level) - The input data definition is missing or empty.
 *  \li DataType - A field or object contains data of an unexpected type.
 *  \li NumericBound - A numeric field violates a field-level min or max bound.
 *  \li NameConflict - Two objects of the same IddObjectType, or with overlapping reference
 *                     lists, have the same name.
 *
 *  Strictness::Final
 *
 *  \li NumericBound - A numeric field violates an (inter-)object-level min or max bound.
 *  \li NullAndRequired - A required field or object is null or missing.
 *  \li NumberOfFields - A data object has too few or too many fields.

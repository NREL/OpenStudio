/** TemperatureUnit is an abstract Unit for handling temperatures. Temperatures can be absolute
 *  or relative. The temperature of a material is absolute temperature. Temperature differences are
 *  relative temperatures. In the former case C != K (F != R), but in the latter, C == K (F == R).
 *
 *  There are no public constructors, because this is an abstract class. By default, derived
 *  classes should set absoute=true. Temperatures that start as relative should be handled by regular
 *  Unit classes. */

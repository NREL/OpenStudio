! This file is the Input Data Dictionary (IDD) for OpenStudio Model.
!
! Please see the EnergyPlus IDD Header for data formatting information. In
! addition to the syntax listed there, we add the following syntax items:
!
! Field-level comments:
!
!  \type handle      The field holds the UUID of the IDF object. This is used in lieu of names
!                    to keep track of references. It also enables \object-list AllObjects, which
!                    can point to any object.
!
!  \type url         The field references a file on at some location.  The reference
!                    may be a relative file path (in which case a set of search locations
!                    are used to find the file at run time), or it may be an
!                    absolute path to a local file.
!
! Object-level comments:
!
!  \url-object       Use if the object includes one or more fields of url type.
!
! Grouping comments:
!
! The groups in the OpenStudio IDD represent high level groupings of similar objects.
! ModelEditor displays un-parented objects in their corresponding group, where each group

        \note radiant system.  The current control temperature (see Temperature Control Type above) is
        \note compared to the high and low control temperatures at the current time.
        \note If the control temperature is above the high temperature, then the

        \note control temperature is below the low temperature, then the inlet
        \note water temperature is set to the high water temperature.  If the control
        \note temperature is between the high and low value, then the inlet water

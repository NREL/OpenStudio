/** Schedule is a ScheduleBase abstract class that represents the reference list 'ScheduleNames'.
 *  The 'ScheduleNames' reference list includes objects of type:
 *     \li OS:Schedule:Year
 *     \li OS:Schedule:Compact
 *     \li OS:Schedule:Constant
 *     \li OS:Schedule:Ruleset
 *     \li OS:Schedule:FixedInterval
 *     \li OS:Schedule:VariableInterval
 *
 *  For detailed information on ScheduleTypeLimits, please see ScheduleBase and
 *  \link ScheduleTypeRegistrySingleton ScheduleTypeRegistry \endlink. In general, ModelObject
 *  setters that take a Schedule will fail if the ScheduleTypeLimits are set and are incompatible
 *  with the proposed use. This ensures that the Schedule is written using units and bounds
 *  expected by the user object (e.g. fractional for lighting schedules, W for people activity
 *  level schedules, C or F for thermostat schedules). */

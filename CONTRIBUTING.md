If you find a bug, you can help us by submitting an issue to our [issues page](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/issues). Before submitting your issue please search existing issues to see if your bug has already been reported.  If reporting a new issue, please be as detailed as you can be in your report to help developers reproduce your issue so they can fix the problem.  For example, report the platform that you are on, the version of OpenStudio you are using, etc. Before reporting an issue please read our [wiki entry](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/Issue-Prioritization) for instructions on properly labelling issues.

## <a name="submit"></a> Want to Submit Code?
If you want to directly submit code to implement a feature or fix a bug then you are our hero.  Small patches or bug fixes are invited via pull requests.  Please read the [information for third party collaborators](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/Information-for-Third-Party-Collaborators) wiki entry for information about this process. However, larger features or substantial development requires following the [OpenStudio contribution policy](https://www.openstudio.net/openstudio-contribution-policy).

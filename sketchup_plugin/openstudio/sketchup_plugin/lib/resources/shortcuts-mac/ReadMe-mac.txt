You can install the keyboard shortcuts for the Mac version of SketchUp by copying "Shortcuts.plist"
to the following directory.
Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp 7/SketchUp/Shortcuts.plist
If you have customized SketchUp's default shortcuts and want to save them,
you should first copy the existing "Shortcuts.plist" to another directory for future use. If you ever
want to get back to SketchUp's default shortcuts you can do that from within SketchUp's preferences.

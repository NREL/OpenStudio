* Getting Started

Open one of the demo Visual C# Project files from the Program Menu or from explorer by navigating to the installation folder and into the "test" subdirectory.

Once the demo project is opened, you will need to delete the existing "OpenStudio" reference from the project and add your own.

Right-click on the reference and choose "Remove." Next, using the menu bar, choose "Project->Add Reference..." Using the ".NET" tab, scroll to the bottom of the list until you find "OpenStudio." Select it and hit "OK."

Your project should now be able to compile.

* Profiling

If you would like to profile the OpenStudio SDK we recommend NProf (http://code.google.com/p/nprof/).

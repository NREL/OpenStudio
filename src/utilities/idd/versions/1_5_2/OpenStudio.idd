! This file is the Input Data Dictionary (IDD) for OpenStudio Model.
!
! Please see the EnergyPlus IDD Header for data formatting information. In
! addition to the syntax listed there, we add the following syntax items:
!
! Field-level comments:
!
!  \type handle      The field holds the UUID of the IDF object. This is used in lieu of names
!                    to keep track of references. It also enables \object-list AllObjects, which
!                    can point to any object.
!
!  \type url         The field references a file on at some location.  The reference
!                    may be a relative file path (in which case a set of search locations
!                    are used to find the file at run time), or it may be an
!                    absolute path to a local file.
!
! Object-level comments:
!
!  \url-object       Use if the object includes one or more fields of url type.
!
! Grouping comments:
!
! The groups in the OpenStudio IDD represent high level groupings of similar objects.
! ModelEditor displays un-parented objects in their corresponding group, where each group

OS:Table:MultiVariableLookup,
       \memo The multi-variable lookup table can represent from 1 to 5 independent variables and
       \memo can interpolate these independent variables up to a 4th order polynomial. The

       \memo When any independent variable value is outside the table limits, linear extrapolation
       \memo is used to predict the table result and is based on the two nearest data points in the
       \memo table for that particularindependent variable.

       \memo air system serving the zone from the air loop.
       \memo Equipment is simulated in the order specified by Zone Equipment Cooling Sequence and
       \memo Zone Equipment Heating or No-Load Sequence, depending on the thermostat request.
       \memo For equipment of similar type, assign sequence 1 to the first system intended to
       \memo serve that type of load.  For situations where one or more equipment types has limited capacity or
       \memo limited control, order the sequence so that the most controllable piece of equipment runs last.
       \memo For example, with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), the air terminal for the DOAS
       \memo should be assigned Heating Sequence = 1 and Cooling Sequence = 1.  Any other equipment should
       \memo be assigned sequence 2 or higher so that it will see the net load after the DOAS air is added
       \memo to the zone.

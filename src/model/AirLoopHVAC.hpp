   * 0 and 1.  If dual duct, key methods including supplyOutletNodes(), demandInletNodes(), and zoneSplitters(),
   * will return a vector with exactly two items.  Item 0 in the supplyOutletNodes vector matches to item
   * 0 in the demandInletNodes vector, and the zoneSplitters vector.  In this way the interface avoids
   * declaring the paths as heating, cooling, ventilation, etc.  It is the client's responsibilty to choose
   * what types of equipment to apply to the two branches.  Note that these indexes carry through to the terminals.
   * Dual duct terminals are Mixer objects which have the method inletModelObjects(branchIndex).  The branchIndex 0

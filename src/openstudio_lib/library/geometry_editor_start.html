<h2>Overview</h2> 

Choose a geometry type from the list above.  <a href="#floorspace">FloorspaceJS</a> allows you to create new geometry based on 2D floorplans.  Alternatively, you can import existing geometry in <a href="#gbxml">gbXML</a>, <a href="#idf">IDF</a>, or <a href="#osm">OSM</a> formats.  Preview what your geometry will look like after translation to OSM format using the "Preview OSM" button.  Once you are satisfied with your geometry, press the "Merge with Current OSM" button to <a href="#merge">merge</a> your new geometry with your current OSM model.  Your current OSM model will not be changed until "Merge with Current OSM" is pressed.

<h2>FloorspaceJS</h2> 

<a href="https://github.com/NREL/floorspace.js">FloorspaceJS</a> is an open source software module that developers can leverage to produce building energy modeling UIs which include geometry creation.  FloorspaceJS is meant to cover simple building geometry use cases only.  More complex building geometry is best developed in a full featured CAD tool and exported to gbXML or other formats for building energy modeling.  FloorspaceJS is implemented in JavaScript with minimal dependencies, allowing it to be integrated into a wide range of applications, including the OpenStudio Application.

<div id="gbxml"></div>
<h2>gbXML</h2> 

<a href="http://gbxml.org/">gbXML</a> is an industry supported XML schema for sharing building information between Building Energy Modeling (BEM) tools. Many BEM tools can author gbXML, a partial list is available online at <a href="http://gbxml.org/Software_Tools_that_Support_GreenBuildingXML_gbXML">http://gbxml.org/Software_Tools_that_Support_GreenBuildingXML_gbXML</a>.  A gbXML viewer developed by Ladybug Tools, <a href="https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-gbxml-tools/tree/develop/gbxml-viewer-basic">https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-gbxml-tools/tree/develop/gbxml-viewer-basic</a>, has been embedded in the OpenStudio Application to preview gbXML before it is translated to OSM.  Ladybug Tools has also developed a more full-featured tool, including the ability to inspect and edit gbXML files, which is available at <a href="https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer">https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer</a>.

<div id="idf"></div>
<h2>IDF</h2> 

The EnergyPlus Input Data Format (IDF) is the file format read by the <a href="https://energyplus.net/">EnergyPlus</a> simulation engine.  Several tools are available which can author IDF, a partial list is available online at <a href="http://www.buildingenergysoftwaretools.com/">http://www.buildingenergysoftwaretools.com/</a>.  A custom viewer has been implemented which displays the contents of the IDF file in epJSON format.  The EnergyPlus executable shipped with OpenStudio is used to convert IDF to epJSON format.  For best results, please ensure that your IDF files are updated to the version of EnergyPlus used by this version of OpenStudio.  IDF files can be updated to the latest version of EnergyPlus using the EP-Launch utility distributed with the full EnergyPlus installer (it is not included with OpenStudio).

<div id="osm"></div>
<h2>OSM</h2> 

The OpenStudio Model (OSM) file format is the native file format used by <a href="https://openstudio.net/">OpenStudio</a>.  OSM files authored in separate workflows may be imported and merged with the current OpenStudio Model.

<div id="merge"></div>
<h2>Merge OSM</h2> 
The OpenStudio SDK includes translators from a variety of common Building Energy Modeling (BEM) formats to OSM.  Geometry from these formats can be converted to OSM and used as a starting point for more detailed OpenStudio Model adjustments such as defining schedules, constructions, and HVAC. A new merge feature was recently added to the OpenStudio SDK.  This feature supports iterative workflows where:

<ol>
  <li>Initial OSM geometry is translated from an original format (e.g. gbXML, IDF, etc)</li>
  <li>Non-geometry modifications (e.g. schedules, HVAC, etc) are made to the OSM</li>
  <li>Updated geometry is available in the original format</li>
</ol>  

The merge feature allows updated geometry to be merged with the current OSM while also preserving non-geometry modifications.

Unsure if we should match class to idd name including _ or not, inconsistent but not including _ seems to be most common.

Groups should be used in model editor to determine where top level objects are presented, groups should be collapsable in model editor

These classes/data models need work:

OS:ComponentCost:LineItem
OS:Meter
OS:Variable

These classes do not match idd entries (will need to change either class name or idd):

AirGap

Be very consistent on attribute names, follow algorithm (concat and lower case first letter) and stick to it!  We can change field names now...

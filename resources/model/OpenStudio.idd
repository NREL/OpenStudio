! This file is the Input Data Dictionary (IDD) for OpenStudio Model.
!
! Please see the EnergyPlus IDD Header for data formatting information. In
! addition to the syntax listed there, we add the following syntax items:
!
! Field-level comments:
!
!  \type handle      The field holds the UUID of the IDF object. This is used in lieu of names
!                    to keep track of references. It also enables \object-list AllObjects, which
!                    can point to any object.
!
!  \type url         The field references a file on at some location.  The reference
!                    may be a relative file path (in which case a set of search locations
!                    are used to find the file at run time), or it may be an
!                    absolute path to a local file.
!
! Object-level comments:
!
!  \url-object       Use if the object includes one or more fields of url type.
!
! Grouping comments:
!
! The groups in the OpenStudio IDD represent high level groupings of similar objects.
! ModelEditor displays un-parented objects in their corresponding group, where each group
! is collapsible.
